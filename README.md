# bpf-info
This is an MkDocs site that we can use to organize all the information we have about BPF and BPF projects.
At this point in time (Jan 2024) we have a lot of group members with a lot of knowledge, but many of them will be graduating soon.
We should capture as much of this knowledge here for new members, and for reference.

## Using MkDocs
To use MkDocs make sure that you have Python3 installed.
If you want, you can make a virtual enviornment just for mkdocs using the command
```
python -m venv [path to venv dir]
```

If you use a virtual environment, make sure to use the binaries located in `[venv_path]/bin` when installing and using MkDocs.

### Basic steps
1. `pip install mkdocs`
2. `mkdocs build` to build the static site
3. `mkdocs serve` to serve it locally

### Official Installation
The official installation guide for MkDocs can be found [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/)
