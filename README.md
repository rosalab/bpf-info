# bpf-info
This is an MkDocs site that we can use to organize all the information we have about BPF and BPF projects.
At this point in time (Jan 2024) we have a lot of group members with a lot of knowledge, but many of them will be graduating soon.
We should capture as much of this knowledge here for new members, and for reference.

## Using MkDocs
TODO: in progress.

Basic steps
1. `pip install mkdocs`
2. `mkdocs build` to build the static site
3. `mkdocs serve` to serve it locally

MkDocs uses markdown files to create a static website.
